A decision tree is a tree-based supervised machine learning model.

Decision trees are made up of nodes and leaves.

The top most node is called the root node or the root, while the nodes below the
it are called internal nodes, decision nodes or branches.

Leaves are simply internal nodes that have incoming links from other nodes but
no outgoing links.

A decision tree makes predictions/decisions by following a chain of checks
through the nodes to reach a conclusion - the leaves.

Decision trees are classified into two:
    - [[Classification Decision Tree|Classification trees]]
    - [[Regression Decision Tree|Regression trees]]
