**Learning objectives**
1. Demonstrate using git commands hoe to initialize a repository, track changes and commit updates.
2. Explain the role of GitHub in saving code remotely.
3. Appy Git and GitHub in a structured workflow.

**Intro**
We use git in order to avoid loosing all our development work by saving a version of it on our computer and on the web.

Git and GitHub also helps us to manage our code while working with teams so to avoid overwriting each others code.

Git is a version control system

Why use GitHub?
1. We can always go back to the previous version of the code we were working on.
2. We always have proof of progress made.
3. Each piece of progress is authored, meaning no one can take credit for your work.
4. We can preserve unused code that we may want to use later.
