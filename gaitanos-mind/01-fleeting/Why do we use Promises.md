[[What are Promises (Programming)|Promises]] are useful when working with operations that don't return a result
immediately - Asynchronous Operations.

During these Async operations, promises are used to represent a value that will
be available later when the async operation is done. 

Either the promise will resolve(succeed) or reject(fail), and the programmer
defines what happens in either case.
