# AI Hackathon Solution

## What do we need to achieve?

- A real world problem
- An Ai Solution

## What is our "Real World" Problem?

1. Lack of end-to-end visibility in fragmented logistics networks

   ### Why is this a real problem?
   - Counterfeit goods go unnoticed
   - Theft/Loss of goods
   - Difficult to track or improve delivery time choke points

   ### What are the Constraints?
   - Low or no internet.
   - Limited Technology;
     - "Katululus" are commonly used.
   - Multiple people involved in the delivery process.
   - Dishonesty

   ### What is our solution?
   - Provide a system design that that links separate supply chain data
     - This provides real-time or near-real-time data on the goods being tracked
   - Use technology that doesn't require internet or tech-savieness
     - Web-apps
     - USSD Codes
     - IOT Devices
     - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
     - Mesh Networks
   - Setup Data-sharing protocols and incentive mechanisms for data entry

   ### What role does AI play in our solution?
   - choke points
   - inconsistent data

2. Urban planning ==(Ian)==
   - 3d map
   - ai for urban planning
     - check for routes
     - bussiness locations
     - deconjestion
   - Google Earth with Ai
