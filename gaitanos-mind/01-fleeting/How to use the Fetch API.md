To use the [[What is the Fetch API|Fetch API]], you use the `fetch()` method. The method takes one
mandatory argument which is the path to the resource you want to fetch and an
optional argument which is an object of options you want to pass to the request.

The API then returns a [[What are Promises (Programming)|promise]] that is resolved once the request is returns a
response - even if it's a 404 error response.
