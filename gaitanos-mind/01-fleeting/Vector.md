A vector is physical quantity that cannot be expressed by a single number
([[Scalar]]).

Historically, vectors have been used to represent quantities that have both a
length and a direction.

Vectors can be added and multiplied(scaled) to form a [[Vector Space|Vector space]].

Vectors are usually represented graphically using an arrow connecting the
starting point and the end point,

and denoted by $\vec{a}$.
