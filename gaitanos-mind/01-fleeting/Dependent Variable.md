A variable is considered **dependent** if it depends, or is hypothesized to on
the values of an [[Independent Variable|Independent variable]].

This dependency has to be implemented by some sort of rule or law. For example,
a mathematical function,

$$
z = f(x, y)
$$

Here, the variable "z" is dependent on "x" and "y".
