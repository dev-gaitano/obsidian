UML stands for Unified Modelling Language.

We are going to study uml 2.0.

UML standardizes the elements that can be used to represent the information.

Uses graphical notations to represent the software's design.

There are two main types of UML diagrams:
	1. Structural Diagrams - There are 7 types
		1. Composite Structure Diagram
		2. Deployment Diagram
		3. Package Diagram
		4. Profile Diagram
		5. Class Diagram
		6. Object Diagram
		7. Component Diagram
	2. Behavioral Diagrams - There are 4 types
		1. Activity Diagram
		2. Use Case Diagram
		3. State Machine Diagram
		4. Interaction Diagram - There are 4 types
			1. Sequence Diagram
			2. Communication Diagram
			3. Interaction Overview Diagram
			4. Timing Diagram
