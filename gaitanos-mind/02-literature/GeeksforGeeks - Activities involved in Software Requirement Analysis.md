[Activities involved in Software Requirement Analysis - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/activities-involved-in-software-requirement-analysis/)

Focus on studying/examining(analyzing) what the software needs(requires) in order to achieve its purpose.

Activities involved in analyzing what a software needs include:

1. Problem Recognition
	We need to fully understand the purpose of every requirement we are adding to the software.
	
	Ask yourself:
	*"Why it (the requirement) is needed?
	Does it add value to product? 
	Will it be beneficial? 
	Does it increase quality of the project? 
	Will have any other effect?"*
	
	Each requirement we add to the software should be solving a problem in the software.
	This will ensure each requirement we add to the software is essential and beneficial to the software.

2. Evaluation and synthesis
	In this stage we are judging(evaluating) how important each requirement really is, and creating(synthesizing) a framework that allows the requirements we've gathered to work together as one system.
	
	Tasks in this stage include:
	- To define all functions of software that necessary.
	- To define all pieces of data that the software deals with, that the end user can see, modify and interact with.
	- To evaluate whether the flow of data is structured in the most efficient way.
	- To fully understand overall behavior of the system (overall working of system) during normal and extreme situations.
	- To identify and discover constraints that affect how the system is designed. ==e.g. Hardware limitations.==
	- To define and establish the character of the system interface to fully understand how the system components interact with one another.

3. Modelling
	After collecting data using the previous tasks, we need to present the systems ==structure and behavior== using a domain or conceptual model.

4. Specification
	In this stage we prepare a Software Requirement Specification (SRS), to specify both the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.

5. Review
	After preparing the SRS we need to review it in order to know whether it can be improved or not.
	We do this in order to make sure the end-product's quality is at its best.
