We need to understand the [[Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)]]
SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle
SDLC helps the software developer understand the client's requirements

Crucial stages of the SDLC process.

1. Planning Phase
	*==See also - [[The SDLC Planning phase]]==*
	1. The purpose of the application
	2. Details about the end-user of the Product
	3. Key elements like the format and attributes for designing
	4. The overall user interfaces design of the software.

1. Requirement Analysis Phase
	*==See also - [[The SDLC Requirement Analysis Phase]]==*
	1. Info about each element to design the software.
	2. Validating the installation of elements in the app according to the clients requirements.
	3. Calibrating the security protocols and risk analysis for the app.
	4. All of this info is then filed in a SRS (Software Requirement Specification) Document.

3. Designing Phase
	1. Software designers will devise a system following the SRS Document.
	2. The system design defines the blueprint of the whole app and checks if the app meets the client's requirements.
	3. All the info of the design phase is filed in the DDS (Design Document Specification) Document.

4. Implementation / coding Phase
	1. The developers start writing the code using the languages they agreed on.
	2. Actual implementation of the Software Requirement Specifications.
	3. Developers use development tools such as compilers and debuggers to implement the code.

5. Testing Phase
	1. The app is deployed in multiple test environments to check all the functioning attributes in the software.
	2. Any bugs or errors found are forwarded back to the development team.
	3. Testing and debugging is continued until the software is stable.

6. Deployment and Maintenance Phase
	1. The app is deployed to the consumers.
	2. An installation link is setup to allow users to access the app.
	3. Debugging and updating of the app is done on a regular basis.
