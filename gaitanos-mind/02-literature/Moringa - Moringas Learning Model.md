Most students don't come to Moringa to learn How to code, but to start a new career.

Most successful graduates in the job search process and finding employment, possess the following:
1. An understanding of their strengths, weakness and passions in order to find a job that suites them best. After understanding these aspects of their character, it becomes easier to convey them positively during an interview ==(Especially the weaknesses)==.

2. Resumes that clearly show a correlation between their past jobs and the one they are currently applying for (even if that past experience wasn't in the tech industry!).

3. Cover letters that convey an authentic, multifaceted personality. And show why they are the best fit for the role, both technically and culturally.

4. An awareness of the person they want to be seen as, this will helps them convey that personality ==(You can't be what you want, if you don't know what you want)==.

5. Soft skills necessary to succeed on a team, and how to demonstrate those skills to the employers/interviewers.

6. Clear goals and trajectories.

==*The main aspects to successfully finding a satisfying job is 
	(1)Defining what a success and satisfying a job is to you (Understanding what you want)
	(2) Being able to make the interviewer believe that you are the perfect fit for the role.*==

Sal Khan - Khan Academy

All the pros at their craft had to learn everything they know. No one is born being good at anything.

You also need to adopt the mentality that you can learn anything you put your mind to - A growthÂ­ mindset.

Fixed Mindset - Intelligence is Fixed.
Growth Mindset - Intelligence can be grown through effort.

Growth Mindset Interventions - They praise and acknowledge the effort rather than an innate ability, e.g. I really like how you struggled with that problem.

*"As long as they embrace struggle and mistakes, they can learn anything."*
