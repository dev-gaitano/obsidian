We will be discussing Asking and Listening

The learning objectives for this lesson are:
1. Evaluate the importance of asking questions.
2. Demonstrate active listening skills.
3. Apply effective asking and listening techniques.

**Evaluating the importance of asking questions**
When working with others questions are more important than having all the answers.
==Why?==

Asking your questions encourages inclusivity in the work place, building good working relationships between you and your peers.

Good working relationships in the workplace boost the productivity of everyone involved.

*"...start with questions, not answers"*

Examples of questions that are relevant and useful in the workplace
- "What do you think?"
- "I have an idea. Can I run it by you?"
- "Do you mind if I try something?"

After asking questions, the next best  step is to listen.

**Demonstrating active listening skills**
There is no need to ask questions if you don't intend on listening to your pair's response

In order to be a better listener you need to do the following:
1. Don't just listen, but understand what is being said. If you don't understand let the person speaking know you don't understand through asking more questions ==(overcommunicate)==
2. Respond based on what has been said, not based on what you think "should" be done.

**Applying effective asking and listening techniques**
1. Don't cut someone off or interrupt them. This give the impression that you don't care about what they are talking about.
2. Don't give an opinion without being asked.
3. Be aware and considerate to others' thoughts and feelings.
4. Don't act as though you have all the answers. Comes off as arrogant.
5. Making assumptions and unresolving miscommunications.
