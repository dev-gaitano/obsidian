Django is a highspeed MVC [[framework]] for building web apps.

Requirement for creating a web app:
	- Import a HTTP library.
	- Pick a port to run the web app on.
	- Expose an endpoint type of method.
	- Manually write the response.
	- Keep server running.

MVC - Model View Controller

The **CONTROLLER** part of the MVC will help you define all the routes for your web app.
	/home
	/about
	/services/: id

The **VIEW** has [[Template]]s that define what the UI should look like.

The **MODEL** contains all the business logic, it interacts with the data from the database.

What are the benefits of using Django?
1. Rapid web app development
	Everything important has already been defined

2. Extensive library of services
	Security
	Sessions
	Auth, etc.

3. Its scalable because it offers a ready made structure to build of off.
