Django is a highspeed MVC [[framework]] for building web apps.

Requirement for creating a web app:
	- Import a HTTP library.
	- Pick a port to run the web app on.
	- Expose an endpoint type of method.
	- Manually write the response.
	- Keep server running.

MVC - Model View Controller

The **CONTROLLER** part of the MVC will help you define all the routes for your web app.
	/home
	/about
	/services/: id

The **VIEW** has [[3 - Permanent Notes/Template]]s that define what the UI should look like.

The **MODEL** contains all the business logic, it interacts with the data from the database.

	Sessions
	Auth, etc.
