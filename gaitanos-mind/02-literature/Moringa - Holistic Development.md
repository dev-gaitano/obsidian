[Active Listening: Foundation of Software Development](https://learn.moringaschool.com/courses/156/pages/active-listening?module_item_id=23652)

Moringa is set up to emulate professional tech setting that you will interact with after classes.

Understand you are the project.

Succeeding after school requires developing non-technical skills such as:
	1. Handling yourself well in front of other professionals
	2. Communicating with confidence.
	3. Understanding the roles in a development team.

Most of these non-technical skills are built through interacting with your fellow students while at Moringa.

Use Moringa to prepare for a work environment.

Every interaction is an opportunity to grow your skills as a developer - both technical and non-technical.

***"_During your time at Moringa_, use the lessons to prepare for the job search and the first weeks and months of work.**

**_During your first week of internship or job_, don't forget that you're the project. Every interaction, like every technical responsibility, is an opportunity to grow as a developer."***

You always get back what you give.
