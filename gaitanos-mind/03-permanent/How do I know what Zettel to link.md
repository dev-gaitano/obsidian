###### DOs
1. Link another when it adds to the information in the Zettel.
2. When two Zettels' concepts are strongly related.
3. When you pose an idea or a question. (The last line of '[[Conducting a literature review]]' is a perfect example.)
###### DON'Ts
1. Linking every word. This will result in an overload of information.
2. Linking items where you can't explain the reason to.
3. Using automatic link generators.
