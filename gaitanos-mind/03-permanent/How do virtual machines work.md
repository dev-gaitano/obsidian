Virtual machines use virtualization technology to create a virtual hardware.
The physical machine is called a host while the VMs running are called the guests.
Multiple VMs can be hosted on one physical machine by running each VM on a separate isolated partition on the host.
This partitioning is managed by a software layer called a [[Hypervisor]].
