In [[Programming|programming]], libraries are specialized, pre-written pieces of code that
developers use, in order to avoid performing repetitive tasks from scratch.

Libraries are a category of [[Packages|packages]].

They save time and effort because the provide reusability for ***specific***, repetitive tasks.

***They are called by the developer at any point throughout the code. The developer controls the flow.***

They are installed using package managers such as [[Pip|pip]] for python.

There are two types of libraries:
	1. Built-in libraries.
	2. Third party libraries.
