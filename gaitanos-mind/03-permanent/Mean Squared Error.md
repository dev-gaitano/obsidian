The Mean Squared Error(MSE), also known as the Mean Squared Deviation(MSD) is a 
variable that measures the average squared Error/[[Residual]].

It is calculated as follows;

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{\text{Sum of Squared Residuals}}{n}
$$

Where $n$ is the number of points in the data set.

Therefore,
$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
$$

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (e_i)^2}{n}
$$
