# C Programming Language

C is a general-purpose [[Programming|programming]] Language and a successor to the B Programing
Language.

The language gives the programmer [[*]]relatively direct access to the CPU Hardware.

Due to its ability to communicate closely with low-level CPU features, it's used
to implement;

- Operating Systems ( escpecially kernels )
- Device Drivers
- Protocol stacks
- Application Software ( been on a decline )
