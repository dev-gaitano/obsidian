In the Zettelkasten method notes are referred to as zettels ([[What is a Zettel]]). These zettels go through three stages in order to be considered done or permanent.
1. Create short and condensed notes while reading or going about your day. These notes are called Fleeting notes because we are bound to forget them if we do not record them in the moment.
2. At the end of the day, create individual notes by fleshing out your fleeting notes and referencing other related notes, in context to the source material. Try to add the extra flesh(information) through recalling and only refer to the source material when it's necessary to do so. This helps you train your brain to actively remember information learnt. These notes are known as literature notes.
3. Update already existing notes with the new literature notes. These "already existing notes" are known as permanent notes. Add the literature notes to the permanent notes now referencing all the notes already existent in your whole Zettelkasten.
