A for loop is a [[Loop Statement|loop statement]] used when you already know how many times
you want to repeat (iterate) the code block.

Unlike other [[Loop Statement|loop statements]] takes in three arguments when called,
   - Initialization
   - Condition 
   - Iteration

And similar to a [[While Loop|while loop]], the for loop only runs the code block if the condition is met.
