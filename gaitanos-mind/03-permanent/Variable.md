In [[Programming|programming]], a variable is a store of value(s) to be used during computation.

The stored value (which can either be of known or unknown quantity) is paired with a
symbolic name known as the variable name that is used to reference the stored value(s).

The variable name is often descriptive to give a hint of the stored
value or use of the variable.

Variables can also be constants.
