Our beliefs about ourselves and the world determine the type of habits we have,
and these beliefs are tied to the identity we associate with ourselves. 

While building a new habit there's always an identity conflict between the
person we believe we are and the person we are trying to become. This is makes 
building new habits difficult.

To ensure the new habits stick we have to embrace the conflict until the new
habit becomes part of our identity and we believe we are who we say we are.
