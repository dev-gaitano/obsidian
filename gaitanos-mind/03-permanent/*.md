## [[C Programming Language|c programming Language]]

### relatively

Allows the programmer to work quite closely with the System hardware e.g memory
management, but not low-level as Assembly. This is because there is still a
layer of abstraction as you are still working in a programming language with its
owm semantics and you are typically not going to be writing raw machine code in
C.

"relative" in this case implies, "relative" to most other languages.
