1. Identifying the Objectives
	Define the purpose of the software and what it will need to achieve that purpose.
	Document a **Business case** that justifies the need for the software.

2. Feasibility Study
	Technically - Can the software be developed with the currently available tools?
	Economically - Is the project cost justified and/or available?
	Operationally - Can the software be integrated and operated effectively in the organization?
	Legally and Environmentally - Does this project comply with legal rules and regulations?

3. Stakeholder Identification
	Identify;
		Business owners
		The target audience
		Development teams

4. Resource Allocation
	Determine the required resources (Software, tools, infrastructure, etc.) and assign responsibilities to team members (Project Managers, Developers, testers, etc.)

5. Risk Assessment.
	Identify potential risks 
		Budget overruns, 
		Scope creep (uncontrolled expansion of the project), 
		Resource constraints
	 and develop a risk mitigation plan

6. Defining the Scope.
	Clearly outline the scope boundaries - What the final product will deliver (in-scope items) and what it won't (out-of-scope items).
	This will help mitigate scope creep.

7. Timeline and Milestones.
	Develop a clear project timeline with milestones and deadlines for each phase of development.
	In your timeline, include time for unexpected errors and corrections.

8. Budget Planning.
	Create an estimate for the total cost of all the resources needed to achieve the desired final product.

1. Documentation.
	Develop the project charter/plan document
