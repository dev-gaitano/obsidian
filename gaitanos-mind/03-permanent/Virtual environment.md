A virtual environment(venv) is a self-contained directory that contains a project's [[Dependencies]] and settings.

It isolates a project's [[Packages]] from system-wide packages, this avoids conflicts with other projects as changes done in one project don't affect other projects and different package versions can be used in different projects as required.

Using a virtual environment also makes it easier to share project files, as each project file has its set of dependencies that the person on the receiving end can install.
