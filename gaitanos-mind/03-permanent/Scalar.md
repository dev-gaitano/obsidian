A scalar is a physical quantity that can be expressed by a single number.
For example, 1, -7, 0.5. or even more ==complex numbers==.

Scalars tell [[Vector|vectors]] how big or small to be inside a [[Vector Space|vector space]].

This process of shrinking or streching vectors using scalars, is called scalar
multiplication.
