Think of each Zettel([[What is a Zettel]]) as a chain/link that builds off of another, this will allow you to easily integrate new ideas, insights, questions and observations with already existing Zettels.
When you get a new idea write it down as a fleeting Zettels, then do some reasearch on the said idea in order to flesh it out in a factual way, then convert the literature Zettel to a permanent one.
