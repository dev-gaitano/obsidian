The Coefficient of Determination is the size of variation in the [[Dependent Variable|Dependent variable]]
that can be predicted from the [[Independent Variable|Independent variable(s)]]. 

It's used in models where the main goal is to predict future outcomes or test
theories, based on other related information.

It simply provides a measure of how well observed data is replicated by the
model.

The formula to calculate r-squared is as follows;

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_res}{SS_tot}
$$

$SS_res$ = Sum of squared [[Residual|residuals]]
$SS_tot$ = Sum of squares around the mean
