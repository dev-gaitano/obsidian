"You can't acknowledge something you don't know exists."

You need to understand what success means in order to know what you need to do in order to achieve that success.

You need to clearly define what success, means to you and your team in order to set up systems that will help you achieve it.

Examples:
	- Number of users within the first month.
	- User retention rate.
	- Ratings and reviews from early adopters.
