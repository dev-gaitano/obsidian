Imagine one person looking at a train and another inside the train, looking
from the train. The person looking "at" the train, sees being in the train as
something that they are not, as something outside of themselves, while the
person looking "from" the train sees being outside the train as something that
they were. They no longer associate themselves with being outside the train.

With goals the logic is the same, if you already identify with becoming the
person you want to be, you become that person. Even if you haven't achieved
pysically you have already achieved it mentally and spiritually and with the
right processes/systems in place you will materialize that reality.
