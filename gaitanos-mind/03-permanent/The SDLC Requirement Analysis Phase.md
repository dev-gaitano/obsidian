------------------------------------
The purpose of this phase in the SDLC, is to analyze and understand each of the software requirements we received from the stakeholders in the [[The SDLC Planning phase]].

In this phase, we will be judging how important / what value a particular requirement is bringing to the end product.

After settling on the requirements we are going to be needing in our final product, we will then need to understand how different components of the software will work and communicate with each other, the data and external entities such as user input.

Using a context diagram will help the developers and the stakeholders better understand how the different components interact with each other, and also reinforce the boundaries / scope of the software.

In this phase, we also need to model a visual representation of the software's structure, using diagrams such as:
	1. [[Unified Modelling Language (UML)]]
	2. Data Flow diagram
	3. Entity-Relationship diagram
	4. Data Dictionaries
	5. State-transition diagrams

At the end of this phase we need to document all these requirements in a structured way, to ensure all project members are on the same page and to also provide the members with something to refer to if any conflict or confusion occurs in future.

This documentation can be done in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) Document.
