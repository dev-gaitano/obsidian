It's a process.

This process is used by developers to manage different phases during software development.

The SDLC is structured in phases;
	1. [[The SDLC Planning phase]].
	2. [[The SDLC Requirement Analysis Phase]]
	3. Design phase
	4. Implementation phase
	5. Testing and maintenance phase

How these phases are executed in the development process is defined by a SDLC model/methodology, these models include;
	1. Waterfall model
	2. Agile Model
	3. V-Model
	4. Spiral Model
	5. DevOps Model
	6. Iterative Model
	7. Rapid prototyping
	8. Incremental Model

The SDLC provides a clear roadmap to the whole team, ensuring the final product meets the quality standards defined by the client/the team.
