In [[Programming|programming]], frameworks are pre-written pieces of code,
that provide a structure that developers use as a base to build their applications off of.

They are a category of [[Packages|packages]].

The developer doesn't have to reinvent the wheel.
***They call the developers code. The framework determines the flow of the code, not the developer***

They can be installed through: 
	1. Package managers, e.g. [[Pip|pip]] for python.
	2. Manually installing from the framework's website.
	3. Through the virtual environment.

Examples of frameworks are, the [[Flask web application framework for python|Flask framework]] and the [[Django web application framework for python|Django framework]].
