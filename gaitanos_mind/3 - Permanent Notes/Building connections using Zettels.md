Once you start having a substantial amount of Zettels ([[What is a Zettel]]), clusters of Zettels start to emerge due to linking of multiple ideas (this is where most of the Zettelkasten magic happens), when you start connecting these clusters this is where innovation is born, and ideas that you wouldn't have otherwise noticed start to emerge.
At this point you can start asking yourself 'what if' questions, e.g. What if I connect this cluster with this other one? Start recording possible connections and start to explore them. ([[Exploring gaps for further investigations]])
