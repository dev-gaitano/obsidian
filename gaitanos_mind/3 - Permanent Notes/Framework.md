Frameworks are a category of [[packages]].
They are pre-written pieces of code, that provide a structure that developers use as a base to build their web applications off of.
The developer doesn't have to reinvent the wheel.
***They call the developers code. The framework determines the flow of the code, not the developer***
They can be installed through: 
	1. Package managers, e.g. [[pip]] for python.
	2. Manually installing from the framework's website.
	3. Through the virtual environment.
Examples of frameworks are, [[Flask web application framework for python]] and [[Django web application framework for python]].
