The most common approach to creating a body of work is usually the bottom up approach. Which is:
###### 1. Researching material.
		What are you interested in? Clearly establish the goal you want to achieve in final product.
###### 2. Gaining a deep understanding of the research material ([[Gaining a deep understanding]]).
###### 3. Gaining insights ([[Conducting a literature review]]).
###### 4. Generating original Ideas ([[Exploring gaps for further investigations]]).
###### 5. Creating your work. ([[Analyzing results]])
		Create prototypes to test out your assumptions and analyze your results.
###### 6. Structured writing.
		Write your paper based on your results.
###### 7. Publishing out your work.
