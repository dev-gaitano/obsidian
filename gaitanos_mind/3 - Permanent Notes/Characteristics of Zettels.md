In the Zettelkasten method we have three types of notes known as Zettels ([[What is a Zettel]]). They are:
##### 1. Fleeting Zettels.

These zettels are usually in bullet form or really any method of note taking that allows you to be fast.

They should only contain the things that really matter, because they should be short, concise and give you enough context to be able to flesh them out later without to much struggle.
###### 2. Literature Zettels.

These notes' main role is to flesh out the fleeting notes.

Their bodies explain their headers. Nothing more nothing less. You should not be in a position where the titles fails to fully encapsulate your atomic note, if so, it means you have more than one atomic idea in your note and you have to find a way to break it down into more notes.

Consider your future self a different person, because your future self is not in the same mind space as your present self. With this in mind write as though explaining to someone else avoiding being vague and using abbreviations that may be difficult to piece together in the future.

Reference other notes that are related in reference to the source material. Avoid biases while creating literature notes.
###### 3. Permanent Zettels.

These notes are exactly the same as the literature notes, the only difference is that the notes have the potential to be linked to any other notes in the Zettelkasten. In these Zettels you can bring in your own biases and reference them.
