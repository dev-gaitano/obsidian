###### DOs
1. #Hashtags
2. Create Maps of Content(MOC)
		These are like tables of contents that assist you in getting to specific Zettels.([[What is a Zettel]])
3. Think of it like a database where you can retrieve and reference data in future.
###### DON'Ts
1. Create folders for topics
2. Over tag
		Creating folders and over tagging will end up creating a rigid structure that's hard to work with defeating the purpose of the Zettelkasten.
