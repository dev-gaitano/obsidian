A hypervisor is also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM) or virtualizer.
Its a computer software that abstracts the host machine's resources, such as compute memory and storage into a pool.
This pool of resources can be dynamically allocated to the guest VMs as needed, providing flexibility and improved overall efficiency.
