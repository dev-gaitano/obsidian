Zettels are used when working with the Zettelkasten note taking workflow.
Zettel is the German word for note. It refers to a single note that carries only one atomic idea on it, nothing more nothing less.
Each Zettel has its own unique ID. This ID is used to reference the notes in other Zettels if they happen to have related content.
Each Zettel should be able to make sense on its own without having to reference the other Zettels.
