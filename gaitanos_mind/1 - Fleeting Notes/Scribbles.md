	Unified Modelling Language (UML)

Data Flow diagram,
Entity-Relationship diagram,
Data Dictionaries,
State-transition diagrams

1. Analyze and understand the requirements from stakeholders during the planning phase.
2. Understand how different components of the software will work with each other, data and external entities. (You may use a context diagram)

## UML
Simplifies the software design process.

Sweet spot between Normal language and Code.

Structural issues and errors are noticed early on, before the coding has began, in theory.

All members understand the system structure, reducing code and team conflicts.

\* There are two types:
	1. Structural Diagrams
	2. Behavioral Diagrams

Independent from any programming language.

Helps developers understand what they should Implement.
