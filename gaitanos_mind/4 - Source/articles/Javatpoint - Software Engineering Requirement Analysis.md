[Software Engineering Requirements Analysis - javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/software-engineering-requirement-analysis)

This phase comes after elicitation ==(the process gathering information from stakeholders)==.

Our goal in this phase is to analyze and refine the information given during elicitation so as to clarify points of confusion and decide which requirements are more important than others.

**Steps taken during the requirement analysis phase**

**1. Draw the context diagram**

This is a model that defines the boundaries of the proposed system and and how it interacts with external entities.

**2. Develop Prototypes (Optional)**
A prototype is something that looks and acts as the proposed software, but built quickly and at a relatively low cost.

The purpose of the prototype is to help the client visualize the end-product and help increase the developers' understanding of the requirements.

Helping the client visualize the end-product will also allow them to give better feedback which will allow us (developers) to make the product more attractive.

**3. Model the Requirements**
In this stage we will create graphical representations of how different parts of the software interact with each other.

These graphical representations include, but not limited to:
	Data Flow diagram
	Entity-Relationship diagram
	Data Dictionaries
	State-transition diagrams

**4. Finalize the requirements**
To finalize the analyzed requirements we need to document them in a structured format.
