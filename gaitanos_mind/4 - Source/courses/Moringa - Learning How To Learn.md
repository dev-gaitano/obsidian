Learning objectives
1. Discover how active learning can help you study more effectively. ==What is active learning?==
2. Compare two modes of thinking and their effective use. ==What are these two modes? Focused and Diffuse mode==
3. Identify how brain connections tackle complex information. ==How I'm I going to do the identification? by using the two modes of thinking mentioned in point (2)==
4. Master fun tools to improve your short and long term memory. ==What are these tools?==
5. End cramming and test anxiety with proven project-based guided assessments. ==What are these assessments and how have they been proven?==

Your brain has two different modes of learning:
1. **Focused Mode** - When you are locked in
	
	In focused mode, think of the brain like a pinball machine with tightly packed bumpers and thoughts as the ball.

	The tightly packed bumpers represent common patterns of thinking - things you already know.
	
	This mode is used when solving problems and learning what you already know.
	
	The ball hits the bumpers quickly just as the brain forms connections quickly between already existing thoughts.
	
	But what if the problem is a new idea?

2. **Diffused Mode** - When you are not thinking about anything in particular
	
	In the diffused mode of thinking, the bumpers are more spaced out.
	
	It would take the ball more time to hit the bumpers just as it would take the brain more time to form new connections between new thoughts or understand a new concept.

When you are learning you hop in-between the two modes, you can't be in both modes of thinking at the same time.

Getting stuck while learning or solving a problem might be a signal to take a brake from the work (Sleep on it) and let the diffuse mode to start working.

After taking a break you'll find it easier to form thought connections when go back to the work.

Exercise:
Letâ€™s see if you remember the difference between Focused and Diffuse thinking. List down the properties of both Focused and Diffused modes

1. ==Focused mode is when one is locked in on a specific task, while during diffuse mode the brain is not focused on a particular task.==
2. ==Focused mode is used when working with information you already know, while diffuse mode is used when interacting with new ideas.==

**Learning to code**
Start with the basics. ==Understanding will allow you to build a solid foundation for when you start tackling complex topics.== Starting with the basics will allow you to understand and remember the concepts better, than starting with complex topics.

Try as many examples as you can.

What to do when you encounter a challenge:
1. Try to solve the challenge by doing. This helps you understand the theory and retain what you've learned.
2. Break the problem into smaller pieces.
3. Sleep on it. Focus your attention on something else and approach the problem later with a clear mind.
